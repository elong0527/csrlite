# Clinical analysis and reporting using YAML 

## Why YAML 

YAML is a human-friendly data serialization standard. 
Its design emphasizes readability and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for defining complex structures like clinical analysis plans.

We chose YAML for several key reasons:

*   **Readability:** YAML's clean syntax makes it easy for humans to review, even for non-programmers. This is crucial for clinical plans where clarity and accuracy are paramount.
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** YAML naturally supports hierarchical data, allowing us to organize complex information in a logical and intuitive way. 
This is ideal for representing the nested relationships often found in clinical study designs, such as studies containing multiple analyses from different studies and therapeutic areas of an organization. Each share common characteristics yet require specificity and flexibility.
*   **Language Agnostic:** YAML is a language-agnostic data format, meaning it can be easily parsed and generated by various programming languages (e.g., Python, R). 
This flexibility allows for seamless integration into different analytical workflows and environments.
*   **Version Control Friendly:** The text-based nature of YAML files makes them highly compatible with version control systems like Git. This enables tracking changes, collaborating on plans, and reverting to previous versions with ease, which is essential for maintaining an auditable history of clinical study designs.
*   **AI and Automation Friendly:** YAML's structured and machine-readable format makes it an excellent choice for integration with AI and automation tools. This allows for automated generation, validation.

By leveraging YAML, we aim to create a transparent, maintainable, and collaborative framework for defining and executing clinical analysis and reporting.





```{python}
import polars as pl
from tlfyaml import load_plan

pl.Config.set_tbl_rows(-1)
```

```{python}
# load YAML file after leverage organization.yaml
tlf = load_plan('../examples/yaml/plan_xyz123.yaml')
```

# TLF plan 
```{python}
tlf.get_plan_df()
```

# TLF keywords 

## Population 

```{python}
tlf.get_population_df()
```

## Observation 

```{python}
tlf.get_observation_df()
```

## Parameter 

```{python}
tlf.get_parameter_df()
```

## Group
